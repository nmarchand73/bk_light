# BLE LED Display Toolkit

Utilities for driving the BK-Light ACT1026 32×32 RGB LED matrix over Bluetooth Low Energy using the command sequence extracted from the provided logs. Other panels are not supported.

Everything is now configurable through `config.yaml`, so you can define presets, multi-panel layouts, and runtime modes without touching code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install bleak Pillow PyYAML`
- Bluetooth adapter with BLE support enabled
- Hardware capabilities:
  - BLE 4.0 or newer with GATT/ATT support
  - Central role / GATT client mode
  - LE 1M PHY
  - Long ATT write support (Prepare/Execute or Write-with-response handling for fragmented payloads)
  - MTU negotiation and L2CAP fragmentation

The tools assume the screen advertises as `LED_BLE_*` (BK-Light firmware). Update the MAC address in `config.yaml` (or via `BK_LIGHT_ADDRESS`) if your unit differs.

## Project Structure
- `config.yaml` – device defaults, multi-panel layout, presets, runtime mode.
- `config.py` – loader/validators for the configuration tree.
- `panel_manager.py` – orchestrates single/multi-panel sessions and image slicing.
- `display_session.py` – BLE transport: handshake, ACK tracking, brightness/rotation, auto-reconnect.
- `production.py` – production entrypoint that reads `config.yaml` and runs the selected mode/preset.
- Toolkit scripts (still usable standalone):
  - `clock_display.py`
  - `display_text.py`
  - `send_image.py`
  - `increment_counter.py`
  - `identify_panels.py`
- Legacy smoke tests: `bootstrap_demo.py`, `red_corners.py`.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install bleak Pillow PyYAML
   ```
2. Edit `config.yaml`.
   - Single panel:
     ```yaml
     device:
       address: "F0:27:3C:1A:8B:C3"
     panels:
       list: ["F0:27:3C:1A:8B:C3"]
     ```
   - Multi-panel:
     ```yaml
     panels:
       tile_width: 32
       tile_height: 32
       layout:
         columns: 2
         rows: 1
       list:
         - name: left
           address: "F0:27:3C:1A:8B:C3"
           grid_x: 0
           grid_y: 0
         - name: right
           address: "F0:27:3C:1A:8B:C4"
           grid_x: 1
           grid_y: 0
     ```
     (A bare MAC string is accepted; defaults are inferred.)
3. Pick the runtime mode and preset:
   ```yaml
   runtime:
     mode: clock
     preset: default
     options:
       timezone: "Europe/Paris"
   ```
4. Launch the production entrypoint:
   ```bash
   python production.py
   ```
   Override anything ad hoc:
   ```bash
   python production.py --mode text --text "HELLO" --option color=#00FFAA
   ```
5. Need to identify MAC ↔ panel placement? Run:
   ```bash
   python identify_panels.py
   ```

## Toolkit Scripts
- `clock_display.py` – async HH:MM clock (supports 12/24h, dot flashing, themes).
- `display_text.py` – renders text using presets (colour/background/font/spacing).
- `send_image.py` – uploads any image with fit/cover/scale + rotate/mirror/invert.
- `increment_counter.py` – numeric animation for diagnostics.
- `identify_panels.py` – flashes digits on each configured panel.

Each script honours `--config`, `--address`, and preset overrides so you can reuse the same YAML in development or production.

## Building New Effects
Use Pillow to draw onto a canvas sized to `columns × rows` tiles, then:
```python
async with PanelManager(load_config()) as manager:
    await manager.send_image(image)
```
`PanelManager` slices the image per tile and `BleDisplaySession` handles BLE writes/ACKs for each panel automatically.
